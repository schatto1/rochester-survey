REDCap External Module:

**Rochester Survey Accessibility**

This module was created to help increase the accessibility of REDCap's surveys, particularly by allowing administrators to add Sign Language videos to survey questions and answers.

**Video URL Configuration**

Once the module is enabled on a project, administrators will see a new page under the "External Modules" section in the project sidebar. This page, the "Survey Video Configuration" page, allows administrators to select a project form. When the selection is made, the module creates a table for the administrator to set URLs that point to signer videos for each question and answer choice in that form. They may add more signers for survey participants to choose from. Each signer will have their own column to specify video URLs for. There are also settings on this page to specify which videos, text, or image to show participants as they exit the survey.

As of v1.4.0, these video configurations may now be exported and imported via the buttons at the top of the URL table.
